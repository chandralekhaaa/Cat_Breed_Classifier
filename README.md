# Cat breed classifier

Project Description
<br/>In this project, I have modelled and trained a Convolutional Neural Network to classify cat images into respective breeds.

Tools
<br/>1. Keras
<br/>2. OpenCV

Python libraries used 
<br/>1. numpy 
<br/>2. matplotlib 
<br/>3. tensorflow 
<br/>4. cv2 
<br/>5. os 
<br/>6. sklearn

Data set
<br/>The dataset constitutes images of cats belonging to 3 different breeds - Bengal, Bombay and Ragdoll. It constitutes about 200 images of each of the 3 breeds. 10% of the dataset is used for testing.

Algorithm used
<br/>A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.

Implementation steps
<br/>1. Data collection
<br/>2. Data preprocessing
<br/>3. Model creation
<br/>4. Model training
<br/>5. Model testing
<br/>6. Evaluation of the model

Observations
<br/>The model achieved a test accuracy of about 86%.

Future work
<br/>At the moment, can distinguish 3 different breeds, it can be extended to classify more breeds. Further, the model can be extended to a recommendation system that suggests pet food and accessories just with the image of the pet. This can expanded into a business venture.
